    <abstract>


<t>This specification describes extensions to the SUIT manifest format
defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>. These extensions allow an update
author, update distributor or device operator to more precisely control
the distribution and installation of updates to IoT devices. These
extensions also provide a mechanism to inform a management system of
Software Identifier and Software Bill Of Materials information about an
updated device.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Full management of software updates for unattended, connected devices, such as Internet of Things devices requires a cooperation between the update author(s) and management, distribution, policy enforcement, and auditing systems. This specification provides the extensions to the SUIT manifest (<xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>) that enable an author to coordinate with these other systems. These extensions enable authors to instruct devices to examine update priority, local update authorisation, update lifetime, and system properties. They also enable devices to report and distributors to collect Software Bill of Materials information.</t>

<t>Extensions in this specification are OPTIONAL to implment and OPTIONAL to include in manifests unless otherwise designated.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conventions-and-terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>Additionally, the following terminology is used throughout this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SUIT: Software Update for the Internet of Things, also the IETF working group for this standard.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="extension-metadata"><name>Extension Metadata</name>

<t>Some additional metadata makes management of SUIT updates easier:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CoSWID, CoMID, CoRIM</t>
  <t>Text descriptions of requirements</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="manifest-digest-coswid"><name>suit-coswid</name>

<t>a CoSWID can enable Software Bill-of-Materials use-cases. A CoMID can enable monitoring of expected hardware. A CoRIM (which may contain both CoSWID and CoMID) can enable both of these use-cases, but can also act as the transport for expected values to an attestation Verifier. Tightly coupling update and attestation ensures that verification infrastructure always knows what software to expect on each device.</t>

<t>suit-coswid is a member of the suit-manifest. It contains a Concise Software Identifier (CoSWID) as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid"/>. This element SHOULD be made severable so that it can be discarded by the Recipient or an intermediary if it is not required by the Recipient.</t>

<t>suit-coswid typically requires no processing by the Recipient. However all Recipients MUST NOT fail if a suit-coswid is present.</t>

<t>suit-coswid is RECOMMENDED to implement and RECOMMENDED to include in manifests.</t>

<t>NOTE: CoRIM comprises a list of CoSWID and a list of CoMID, so it may be preferable to a CoSWID.</t>

<t>NOTE: CoMID may be a preferable alternative to Vendor ID/Class ID, however it consumes more bandwidth, so a UUID based on CoMID may be appropriate.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="text-version-required"><name>text-version-required</name>

<t>suit-text-version-required is used to represent a version-based dependency on suit-parameter-version as described in <xref target="suit-parameter-version"/> and <xref target="suit-condition-version"/>. To describe a version dependency, a Manifest Author SHOULD populate the suit-text map with a SUIT_Component_Identifier key for the dependency component, and place in the corresponding map a suit-text-version-required key with a free text expression that is representative of the version constraints placed on the dependency. This text SHOULD be expressive enough that a device operator can be expected to understand the dependency. This is a free text field and there are no specific formatting rules.</t>

<t>By way of example only, to express a dependency on a component "['x', 'y']", where the version should be any v1.x later than v1.2.5, but not v2.0 or above, the author would add the following structure to the suit-text element. Note that this text is in cbor-diag notation.</t>

<section anchor="extension-parameters"><name>Extension Parameters</name>

<t>Several parameters are needed to define the behaviour of the commands specified in <xref target="extension-commands"/>. These parameters follow the same considerations as defined in Section 8.4.8 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>.</t>

<section anchor="suit-parameter-use-before"><name>suit-parameter-use-before</name>

<t>An expiry date for the use of the manifest encoded as the positive integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01. Implementations that use this parameter MUST use a 64-bit internal representation of the integer. Used with <xref target="suit-condition-use-before"/></t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-parameter-minimum-battery"><name>suit-parameter-minimum-battery</name>

<t>This parameter sets the minimum battery level in mWh. This parameter is encoded as a positive integer. Used with suit-condition-minimum-battery (<xref target="suit-condition-minimum-battery"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-parameter-update-priority"><name>suit-parameter-update-priority</name>

<t>This parameter sets the priority of the update. This parameter is encoded as an integer. It is used along with suit-condition-update-authorized (<xref target="suit-condition-update-authorized"/>) to ask an application for permission to initiate an update. This does not constitute a privilege inversion because an explicit request for authorization has been provided by the Update Authority in the form of the suit-condition-update-authorized command.</t>

<t>Applications MAY define their own meanings for the update priority. For example, critical reliability &amp; vulnerability fixes MAY be given negative numbers, while bug fixes MAY be given small positive numbers, and feature additions MAY be given larger positive numbers, which allows an application to make an informed decision about whether and when to allow an update to proceed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-parameter-version"><name>suit-parameter-version</name>

<t>Indicates allowable versions for the specified component. Allowable versions can be specified, either with a list or with range matching. This parameter is compared with version asserted by the current component when suit-condition-version (<xref target="suit-condition-version"/>) is invoked. The current component may assert the current version in many ways, including storage in a parameter storage database, in a metadata object, or in a known location within the component itself.</t>

<t>The component version can be compared as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Greater.</t>
  <t>Greater or Equal.</t>
  <t>Equal.</t>
  <t>Lesser or Equal.</t>
  <t>Lesser.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Versions are encoded as a CBOR list of integers. Comparisons are done on each integer in sequence. Comparison stops after all integers in the list defined by the manifest have been consumed OR after a non-equal match has occurred. For example, if the manifest defines a comparison, "Equal [1]", then this will match all version sequences starting with 1. If a manifest defines both "Greater or Equal [1,0]" and "Lesser [1,10]", then it will match versions 1.0.x up to, but not including 1.10.</t>

<t>While the exact encoding of versions is application-defined, semantic versions map conveniently. For example,</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>1.2.3 = [1,2,3].</t>
  <t>1.2-rc3 = [1,2,-1,3].</t>
  <t>1.2-beta = [1,2,-2].</t>
  <t>1.2-alpha = [1,2,-3].</t>
  <t>1.2-alpha4 = [1,2,-3,4].</t>
</list></t>

<t>suit-condition-version is OPTIONAL to implement.</t>

<t>Versions SHOULD be provided as follows:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The first integer represents the major number. This indicates breaking changes to the component.</t>
  <t>The second integer represents the minor number. This is typically reserved for new features or large, non-breaking changes.</t>
  <t>The third integer is the patch version. This is typically reserved for bug fixes.</t>
  <t>The fourth integer is the build number.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Where Alpha (-3), Beta (-2), and Release Candidate (-1) are used, they are inserted as a negative number between Minor and Patch numbers. This allows these releases to compare correctly with final releases. For example, Version 2.0, RC1 should be lower than Version 2.0.0 and higher than any Version 1.x. By encoding RC as -1, this works correctly: [2,0,-1,1] compares as lower than [2,0,0]. Similarly, beta (-2) is lower than RC and alpha (-3) is lower than RC.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-parameter-wait-info"><name>suit-parameter-wait-info</name>

<t>suit-directive-wait (<xref target="suit-directive-wait"/>) directs the manifest processor to pause until a specified event occurs. The suit-parameter-wait-info encodes the parameters needed for the directive.</t>

<t>The exact implementation of the pause is implementation-defined. For example, this could be done by blocking on a semaphore, registering an event handler and suspending the manifest processor, polling for a notification, or aborting the update entirely, then restarting when a notification is received.</t>

<t>suit-parameter-wait-info is encoded as a map of wait events. When ALL wait events are satisfied, the Manifest Processor continues. The wait events currently defined are described in the following table.</t>

<texttable>
      <ttcol align='left'>Name</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Encoding</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Description</ttcol>
      <c>suit-wait-event-authorization</c>
      <c>int</c>
      <c>Same as suit-parameter-update-priority</c>

      <c>int</c>
      <c>Wait until power state</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-network</c>
      <c>int</c>
      <c>Wait until network state</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-other-device-version</c>
      <c>See below</c>
      <c>Wait for other device to match version</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-time</c>
      <c>uint</c>
      <c>Wait until time (seconds since 1970-01-01)</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-time-of-day</c>
      <c>uint</c>
      <c>Wait until seconds since 00:00:00</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-time-of-day-utc</c>
      <c>uint</c>
      <c>Wait until seconds since 00:00:00 UTC</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-day-of-week</c>
      <c>uint</c>
      <c>Wait until days since Sunday</c>
      <c>suit-wait-event-day-of-week-utc</c>
      <c>uint</c>
      <c>Wait until days since Sunday UTC</c>
</texttable>

<t>suit-wait-event-other-device-version reuses the encoding of suit-parameter-version-match. It is encoded as a sequence that contains an implementation-defined bstr identifier for the other device, and a list of one or more SUIT_Parameter_Version_Match.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-parameter-component-metadata"><name>suit-parameter-component-metadata</name>

<t>In some instances, a system may need to know the file metadata for a component. This metadata can include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>creator</t>
  <t>creation time</t>
  <t>modification time</t>
  <t>default permissions (rwx)</t>
  <t>a map of user/permission pairs</t>
  <t>a map of role/permission pairs</t>
  <t>a map of group/permission pairs</t>
  <t>file type</t>
</list></t>

<t>Component metadata is applied at time of fetch, copy, or write; see <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>, sections 8.4.10.4, 8.4.10.5, 8.4.10.6. Therefore, the component metadata parameter must be set in advance of the component being fetched, copied into, or written.</t>

<section anchor="suit-meta-creator"><name>Creator</name>

<t>Sometimes, management of file systems requires that the creator of each file is correctly recorded. Because the default creator of files will be the update agent, this can obscure the actual creator of each file. The Creator metadata element allows overriding the default behaviour and setting the correct creator.</t>

<t>The creator is defined as follows:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
SUIT_meta_actor_id = UUID_Tagged / bstr / str / int
UUID_Tagged = #6.37(bstr)
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The actor ID can be whatever is most appropriate for any given system. Typically, the actor ID will be a string (e.g., username), integer (e.g., POSIX userid), or UUID (e.g., TEEP TA UUID).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="creation-modification-time"><name>Creation &amp; Modification Time</name>

<t>The creation and modification times are defined by CBOR time types. These are defined in <xref target="RFC8949"/>, Section 3.4.2. The CBOR tag is REQUIRED when either creation or modification time are provided.</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
suit-meta-modification-time => #6.1(uint)
suit-meta-creation-time => #6.1(uint)
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="component-default-permissions"><name>Component Default Permissions</name>

<t>Typical permissions management systems require read, write, and execute permissions that are applied to all users who do not have their own explicit permissions. These are the default permissions for the current component. Default permissions are described by the following CDDL:</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
SUIT_meta_permissions = uint .bits SUIT_meta_permission_bits
SUIT_meta_permission_bits = &(
    r: 2, w: 1, x: 0,
    * $$SUIT_meta_permission_bits_extensions
)
]]></sourcecode></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="user-role-group-permissions"><name>User, Role, Group permissions</name>

<t>Many filesystems have users and groups. Additionally some have roles. Actors that have these associations can have specific permissions associated with them for each component. Each of these sets of permissions is defined the same way: with a map of actor identifiers to permissions.</t>

<figure><sourcecode type="CDDL"><![CDATA[
SUIT_meta_permission_map = {
    + SUIT_meta_actor_id => SUIT_meta_permissions
}
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The SUIT_meta_actor_id is the same as defined for Creator, <xref target="suit-meta-creator"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="file-type"><name>File Type</name>

<t>File Type typically identifies whether a file is a directory, regular file, or symbolic link. If not specified, File Type defaults to regular file.</t>

<t>This enables specific management operations for SUIT command sequences:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>To create a directory  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Set the Component Index to the Component Identifier of the directory to be created</t>
      <t>Set the Component metadata, including the file type for directory</t>
      <t>Set suit-parameter-content to an empty bstr</t>
      <t>Invoke suit-directive-write</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>To create a symbolic link  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Set the Component Index to the Component Identifier of the link to be created</t>
      <t>Set the Component metadata, including the file type for symbolic link</t>
      <t>Set suit-parameter-content to the link target</t>
      <t>Invoke suit-directive-write</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>For example, the following Payload Fetch &amp; Install sequences will create a new /usr/local/bin directory, download https://cdn.example/example3.bin into a new file: /usr/local/bin/example3, then create a symlink at /usr/bin/example that points to /usr/local/bin/example3.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Common has components for:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>/usr/bin/example</t>
      <t>/usr/local/bin</t>
      <t>/usr/local/bin/example3</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Payload fetch:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>set component index = 1</t>
      <t>set parameters:      <list style="symbols">
          <t>content = h''</t>
          <t>metadata = {file-type: directory}</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>write</t>
      <t>set component index = 2</t>
      <t>set URI = "https://cdn.example/example3.bin"</t>
      <t>fetch</t>
      <t>condition image digest</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Install:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>set component index = 0</t>
      <t>set parameters:      <list style="symbols">
          <t>content = "/usr/local/bin/example3"</t>
          <t>metadata = {file-type: symlink}</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>write</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="extension-commands"><name>Extension Commands</name>

<t>The following table defines the semantics of the commands defined in this specification in the same way as in the Abstract Machine Description, Section 6.4, of <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>.</t>

<texttable>
      <ttcol align='left'>Command Name</ttcol>

      <c>suit-directive-copy-params</c>
      <c>current.params[k] = components[i].params[k] for k in l for i,l in arg</c>
</texttable>

<section anchor="suit-condition-use-before"><name>suit-condition-use-before</name>

<t>Verify that the current time is BEFORE the specified time. suit-condition-use-before is used to specify the last time at which an update should be installed. The recipient evaluates the current time against the suit-parameter-use-before parameter (<xref target="suit-parameter-use-before"/>), which must have already been set as a parameter, encoded as seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Timestamp conditions MUST be evaluated in 64 bits, regardless of encoded CBOR size. suit-condition-use-before is OPTIONAL to implement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-condition-image-not-match"><name>suit-condition-image-not-match</name>

<t>Verify that the current component does not match the suit-parameter-image-digest (Section 8.4.8.6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>). If no digest is specified, the condition fails. suit-condition-image-not-match is OPTIONAL to implement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-condition-minimum-battery"><name>suit-condition-minimum-battery</name>

<t>suit-condition-minimum-battery provides a mechanism to test a Recipient's battery level before installing an update. This condition is primarily for use in primary-cell applications, where the battery is only ever discharged. For batteries that are charged, suit-directive-wait is more appropriate, since it defines a "wait" until the battery level is sufficient to install the update. suit-condition-minimum-battery is specified in mWh. suit-condition-minimum-battery is OPTIONAL to implement. suit-condition-minimum-battery consumes suit-parameter-minimum-battery (<xref target="suit-parameter-minimum-battery"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-condition-update-authorized"><name>suit-condition-update-authorized</name>

<t>Request Authorization from the application and fail if not authorized. This can allow a user to decline an update. suit-parameter-update-priority (<xref target="suit-parameter-update-priority"/>) provides an integer priority level that the application can use to determine whether or not to authorize the update. Priorities are application defined. suit-condition-update-authorized is OPTIONAL to implement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-condition-version"><name>suit-condition-version</name>

<t>suit-condition-version allows comparing versions of firmware. Verifying image digests is preferred to version checks because digests are more precise. suit-condition-version examines a component's version against the version info specified in suit-parameter-version (<xref target="suit-parameter-version"/>)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-directive-wait"><name>suit-directive-wait</name>

<t>suit-directive-wait directs the manifest processor to pause until a specified event occurs. Some possible events include:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Authorization</t>
  <t>External Power</t>
  <t>Network availability</t>
  <t>Other Device Firmware Version</t>
  <t>Time</t>
  <t>Time of Day</t>
  <t>Day of Week</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-directive-override-multiple"><name>suit-directive-override-multiple</name>

<t>This directive enables setting parameters for multiple components at the same time. This allows a small reduction in encoding overhead:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>without override-multiple, the encoding for each component consists of:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>set-component-index (2 bytes)</t>
      <t>override-parameters (1 byte + parameter map)</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>with override-multiple, the encoding for each component consists of:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>the component index key (1 byte)</t>
      <t>the parameter map</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Override-multiple requires the command (1-2 bytes) and one additional map to hold the parameter sets (1 byte). For one component, there is no savings. For multiple components, there is an encoding savings of 2 bytes per component.</t>

<t>Proper structuring of code should ensure that override-multiple follows a code-path nearly identical to set-component-index + override-parameters.</t>

<t>This command is purely an encoding alias for set-component-index and override-parameters. The component index is set to the last component listed in the override-multiple argument when override-multiple completes.</t>

<t>The following CDDL defines the argument for suit-directive-override-multiple:</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">CDDL
SUIT_Override_Mult_Arg = {
    uint =&gt; {+ $$SUIT_Parameters}
}
</spanx></t>

</section>
<section anchor="suit-directive-copy-params"><name>suit-directive-copy-params</name>

<t>suit-directive-copy-params enables a manifest author to specify one or more components to copy parameters from, and a list of parameters to copy from each specified source component.</t>

<t>The behaviour is exactly the same as override parameters, but with parameter values defined in existing components. Parameters are only copied between identical keys (no copying from URI to digest, for example).</t>

<t>For each entry in the map, the manifest processor sets the source component to be the component identified by the index contained in the map key. For each parameter identified in the copy list, the manifest processor copies the parameter from the source component to the current component.</t>

<t>The following CDDL defines the argument for suit-directive-copy-params:</t>

SUIT_Directive_Copy_Params = {

	 <t>   ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 Software Identification (SWID) tags provide an
   extensible XML-based structure to identify and describe individual

   representations can be too large for devices with network and storage
   constraints.  This document defines a concise representation of SWID
   tags: Concise SWID (CoSWID) tags.  CoSWID supports a similar set of
   semantics and features as SWID tags, as well as new semantics that
   allow CoSWIDs to describe additional types of information, all in a
   more memory efficient format.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This specification describes the format of a manifest.  A manifest is
   a bundle of metadata about code/data obtained by a recipient (chiefly
   the firmware for an IoT device), where to find the that code/data,
   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information
   protecting the manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation
   both tend to use sequences of common operations, so the manifest
   encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the
   metadata.

      <abstract>
	 <t>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for constrained devices. Ensuring that devices function and remain secure over their service lifetime requires such an update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities, update configuration settings, and add new functionality.

 One component of such a firmware update is a concise and machine-processable metadata document, or manifest, that describes the firmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection. This document describes the information that must be present in the manifest.
